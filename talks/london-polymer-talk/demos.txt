=================================================

Notes:::::: you're adding -element where it isnt necessarily needed to els youre including. Shouldnt do that.

Create the basic app
=====================
yo polymer

New elements
=================
yo polymer:element yt-jukebox
yo polymer:element yt-input

Polymer elements
================

bower install --save Polymer/yt-search
bower install --save Polymer/yt-video

...then replace with your own versions...
or switch.. i think switch.

at this point could show pasting in sample code for search
adding yt-video height and width so youtube shows up.

UI elements
=============

bower install Polymer/polymer-ui-tabs
bower install Polymer/polymer-ui-ratings


What to actually live code vs drop in
======================

div id search
nav
yt-search

player
playlist
history
tabs


Assumptions... copy paste from another window, file? clipboard?
in jS
